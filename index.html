          We have  called our meme AGINU or Agile Inu becasuse of the japanese word
          inu (çŠ¬) for dog and an acknowledgement that Saluki are very agile hunters. 
          The Saluki, a breed renowned for its elegance, speed, and grace, has
          graced human civilization for millennia. Often referred to as the
          "Royal Dog of Egypt," these sighthounds have been revered for their
          hunting prowess and loyalty.

          However, today, the Saluki Dogs faces a harshreality: the threat of extinction. 
          This is where Aginu Coin emerges as a beacon of hope. We are a meme coin like dogecoin or Shiba Inu but
          Aginu Coin leverages the power of blockchain technology and artificial
          intelligence (AI) to publicize Saluki plight and to research on its genetics.

          <h2>The Plight of the Saluki</h2>
          There are several factors contributing to the
          decline of the Saluki population. Limited Gene Pool: Salukis have a
          relatively small gene pool due to their historical role as hunting
          companions for nomadic tribes. This limited genetic diversity makes
          them more susceptible to diseases and reduces their adaptability in a
          changing environment. Habitat Loss: 
           <img src="Endurance.jpeg" alt="Saluki dog running in the desert" /
          class="w3-image">
          The Saluki's native habitat in the
          Fertile Crescent region has been significantly impacted by human
          activities like urbanization and agriculture. This loss of suitable
          land shrinks their territory and hunting grounds. Shifting
          Preferences: Modern hunting practices often favor breeds bred
          specifically for firearm use, diminishing the role of traditional
          sighthounds like the Saluki. The combined effects of these factors
          have pushed the Saluki breed towards a precarious position.
